Joon here, your friendly neighborhood host, ready to dive headfirst into another delicious slice of Korean culture. And today, we are talking about tteokbokki!\n\nNow, for those of you who might not be familiar, tteokbokki—or spicy rice cakes—is, in my humble opinion, the king of Korean street food. It's just... everywhere! You walk down any street in Seoul, and I guarantee you won't have to go far before you smell that sweet and spicy aroma wafting through the air.\n\nI remember when I first came to Seoul. I was completely overwhelmed by the sheer variety of food, but tteokbokki was one of the first things I tried. A little old woman had a small cart set up near my university, and the bright red sauce just beckoned me closer. One bite, and I was hooked! That tteokbokki was 정말... jeongmal... really delicious!\n\nBut tteokbokki is so much more than just a tasty snack. It has a surprisingly long and interesting history. The origins of tteokbokki can be traced back to royal court cuisine during the Joseon Dynasty. Back then, it wasn't the fiery red dish we know and love today. It was actually a savory dish made with soy sauce, beef, and vegetables. Think of it as a more... refined ancestor.\n\nThe spicy version that most of us associate with tteokbokki today didn't really emerge until the 1950s, thanks to a creative woman in Sindang-dong. Sindang-dong is a district in Seoul that's now practically synonymous with tteokbokki. This woman, whose name was Ma Bok-rim, accidentally dropped some gochujang—Korean chili paste—into her tteokbokki while experimenting with new flavors. The rest, as they say, is history!\n\nWhat's interesting is that every region in Korea has its own take on tteokbokki. In some areas, they add seafood; in others, they use different types of rice cakes. There are even variations with cheese, ramen noodles (that's called rabokki), or black bean sauce (that's called gungmul tteokbokki). The possibilities are endless!\n\nBut regardless of the variations, one thing remains the same: tteokbokki is comfort food at its finest. It's the perfect snack to share with friends, whether you're celebrating a special occasion or just hanging out after school. It's the kind of food that warms you up from the inside out, especially on a cold winter day. I think that’s why it holds such a special place in the hearts of Koreans. It's just... masisseoyo... 맛있어요... delicious! It is 정말… jeongmal… really delicious!\n\nSo, the next time you're in Seoul, make sure you try some tteokbokki. Find a street vendor, grab a plate, and experience a true taste of Korean culture. You won't regret it!\n", "speakers": 1, "voices": ["M"], "use_internet": true, "category": "localisation", "theme": "culture", "geo_location": "Seoul", "voice_names": ["Fenrir"], "job_id": "81904ffb-b2d2-4445-86cb-c85b66571ebd"}
